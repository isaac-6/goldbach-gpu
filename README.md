# goldbach-gpu

GPU-accelerated verification of Goldbach's conjecture using CUDA and GMP.

**Goldbach's conjecture** states that every even integer greater than 2 can be
expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. First proposed in 1742, it remains
one of the oldest unsolved problems in mathematics. Verified computationally up
to 4×10¹⁸ by distributed computing [[1]](#references), but never formally proved.

This project provides an open source, reproducible framework for exhaustive
range verification and arbitrary precision single-number checking on consumer
hardware. **No counterexamples have been found in any computation.**

---

## Headline result
The following figure shows total wall‑clock time to verify all even integers up to \(N\) using the three main implementations:

- **CPU baseline** (`cpu_goldbach`)
- **GPU global bitset** (`goldbach_gpu2`)
- **GPU segmented verifier** (`goldbach_gpu3`)

> **All even integers up to 10¹² verified on a single NVIDIA RTX 3070 (8 GB VRAM)
> in 96 minutes with zero failures and zero fallbacks.**

This is achieved by `goldbach_gpu3`, a segmented double-sieve verifier that
removes the VRAM ceiling of earlier designs. See [Architecture](#architecture)
and [Results](#results-summary) below.

## Project goals

- Verify Goldbach's conjecture to the largest range feasible on consumer hardware
- Demonstrate GPU-accelerated number theory with rigorous correctness guarantees
- Benchmark and compare CPU vs GPU architectures for sieve-based computation
- Provide fully reproducible scientific results on a fixed hardware platform
- Serve as a reference implementation for GPU Goldbach verification

---

## Architecture

The project contains five tools of increasing capability, each validating
against the previous:

| Tool | Method | Range | Hard limit |
|------|--------|-------|------------|
| `cpu_goldbach` | CPU sieve + sequential scan | exhaustive | system RAM / time |
| `goldbach_gpu2` | GPU, compact bitset (1 bit/odd) | exhaustive | VRAM (~10¹¹) |
| `goldbach_gpu3` | GPU, segmented double-sieve | exhaustive | time only |
| `single_check` | GPU Miller-Rabin | single number | uint64_t (~1.8×10¹⁹) |
| `big_check` | GMP + OpenMP | single number | time only |

### Design evolution

**goldbach_gpu** stores primality as one byte per number. At 10⁹ this requires
953 MB VRAM -- already approaching limits. Not usable beyond 10⁹ on 8 GB GPUs.

**goldbach_gpu2** encodes one bit per odd number, a 16× memory reduction.
This makes 10¹¹ feasible (5,960 MB) but 10¹² impossible (would need 59 GB).
The VRAM ceiling is architectural -- no amount of runtime can overcome it.

**goldbach_gpu3** removes the ceiling entirely via a segmented design. For each
segment [A, B] of even numbers, it iterates over candidate primes p and marks
all n in [A, B] where n-p is prime as verified. Crucially, q = n-p is checked
globally (small bitset, segment bitset, or Miller-Rabin) -- not forced into
the current segment, which would miss valid partitions. Each segment uses only
~60 MB VRAM regardless of total range. An exhaustive CPU fallback guarantees
rigor for any number the GPU phase does not resolve; in all runs to date,
this fallback has never been triggered.

**big_check** handles numbers of arbitrary digit count using GMP exact
arithmetic and probabilistic Miller-Rabin (25 rounds, false positive
probability < 10⁻¹⁵). OpenMP parallelism with batch-synchronised prime
search prevents thread runaway for large inputs.

### Range verification -- exhaustive, all even n in [4, N]

| Tool | Limit | Even n checked | Total time | Failures |
|------|-------|----------------|------------|----------|
| `cpu_goldbach` (CPU) | 10⁹ | 499,999,999 | 22,622 ms | 0 |
| `cpu_goldbach` (CPU) | 10¹⁰ | 4,999,999,999 | 308,335 ms | 0 |
| `goldbach_gpu2` | 10⁹ | 499,999,999 | 1,386 ms | 0 |
| `goldbach_gpu2` | 10¹⁰ | 4,999,999,999 | 25,443 ms | 0 |
| `goldbach_gpu3` | 10¹² | 499,999,999,999 | 5,760,350 ms | 0 |

GPU speedup over CPU baseline: **16× total at 10⁹, 12× at 10¹⁰**.
goldbach_gpu3 reaches 10¹² which no single-GPU implementation can reach
with a global bitset design on 8 GB VRAM.

### Single number verification

| Tool | n | Partition | Time |
|------|---|-----------|------|
| `single_check` | 10¹⁸ | 14,831 + 999,999,999,999,985,169 | 1.5 s |
| `single_check` | 10¹⁹ | 226,283 + 9,999,999,999,999,773,717 | 1.5 s |
| `big_check` | 10¹⁰⁰⁰ | p = 26,981 | 363 ms (20 threads) |
| `big_check` | 10¹⁰⁰⁰⁰ | p = 47,717 | 182 s (20 threads) |

## Build

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_LEGACY=OFF     # enable legacy tools (like goldbach_gpu) with -DBUILD_LEGACY=ON
make -j$(nproc)
```

**Dependencies:** CUDA toolkit, GMP, OpenMP.

```bash
sudo apt install libgmp-dev    # GMP
# CUDA toolkit: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
```

---

## Usage

All tools now support modular CLI argument parsing and feature dynamic hardware safety guards to prevent Out-Of-Memory (OOM) crashes. Pass `-h` or `--help` to any tool for detailed usage instructions.

All compiled executables are located in the `build/bin/` directory.

### CPU range verifier
```bash
./build/bin/cpu_goldbach 1000000000
```
Useful as a correctness baseline. 
Expected time: ~23 s at 10⁹, ~5 min at 10¹⁰.

### GPU range verifier -- compact bitset (recommended up to 10¹⁰)
```bash
./build/bin/goldbach_gpu2 10000000000
```
Requires VRAM ≥ N/16 bytes. Hardware VRAM is automatically checked at launch. 
Expected time: ~1.4 s at 10⁹, ~25 s at 10¹⁰.

### GPU segmented verifier (recommended for 10¹¹ and beyond)
```bash
./build/bin/goldbach_gpu3 1000000000000
```
No VRAM ceiling. Hardware VRAM is checked against the segment size at launch to ensure safe execution. Expected time: ~96 min at 10¹².

To reproduce the 10¹² result with specific segmentation and prime bounds, you can pass them directly via the CLI (`<LIMIT> [SEG_SIZE] [P_SMALL]`):
```bash
./build/bin/goldbach_gpu3 1000000000000 500000000 2000000
```

### GPU single number checker (up to ~1.8×10¹⁹)
```bash
./build/bin/single_check 999999999999999998
```
Uses deterministic Miller-Rabin with 12 witnesses. Returns a valid partition but not necessarily the minimal one (due to concurrent GPU thread execution).

### Arbitrary precision checker (any size)
```bash
./build/bin/big_check 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
./build/bin/big_check "$(python3 -c "print('1' + '0'*1000)")"    # 10^1000
./build/bin/big_check "$(python3 -c "print('1' + '0'*10000)")"   # 10^10000
```

Candidate primes p are generated deterministically by a standard Sieve of Eratosthenes up to 10^7 (664,579 primes). For each p, q = n - p is computed exactly using GMP arbitrary precision arithmetic, then tested for primality using GMP's Miller-Rabin with 25 rounds (false positive probability < 4^-25 ≈ 10^-15 per test). Since p is sieve-generated, only the test on q is probabilistic.

Primes are processed in batches of 1,000 with a synchronisation barrier between batches. This prevents thread runaway: without batching, fast threads on small-p tests could race far ahead of slow threads doing expensive GMP tests, causing a large non-minimal p to be returned first. With batching, the winning p is the smallest in the first batch containing a valid partition.

Practical limit: GMP primality tests scale roughly as O(d^3) in digit count d. At 10^10000 (d = 10,001) each test takes milliseconds; beyond ~10^50000 each test takes seconds and exhaustive search becomes infeasible in practice.

### Validation tests
The framework includes a comprehensive automated validation suite that tests core functionality, CLI robustness, and negative hardware guards (e.g., safe failure on massive VRAM requests).
```bash
cd tests
./validation.sh
```
